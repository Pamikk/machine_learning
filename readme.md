# Repo Introduction

+ codes written mainly in python and c++ to implement some popular machine learning algorithms

## Structure
+ Notes.md
  + Math and concepts for machine learning from lectures and Cousera
+ Genrative Model
  + This is my machine learning Project 
  + Implement GAN and Variational Auto-Encoder
  + Analysis Difference
  + To do
    + [ ] Transfer from Mnist to Human face Generate or Optical Characters Generate
    + [ ] Implement other version
+ Clustering
